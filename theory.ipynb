Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings
and purposes within the language. 
These keywords cannot be used as variable names or identifiers because
they are predefined and serve specific roles in the syntax and structure of Python code.

"""
Valid Characters:

Identifiers can be a combination of lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0-9),or an underscore (_).
The first character of an identifier cannot be a digit, ensuring that identifiers do not start with a number.
Python identifiers are case-sensitive, so myVariable, MyVariable, and myvariable are all different identifiers.

Cannot Start with a Digit:

An identifier cannot start with a digit. For example, 1variable is not a valid identifier, but variable1 is.

Cannot be a Keyword:

You cannot use reserved words or keywords as identifiers. These are words that Python has reserved for 
specific purposes like defining syntax or functionality.
Examples include if, else, for, while, def, class, etc.

No Special Characters (except underscore _):

Special characters like !, @, #, $, %, etc., are not allowed in identifiers, except for the underscore (_).

No Spaces:

Spaces are not allowed within an identifier. Use underscores or CamelCase for readability.

In Python, comments are used to explain and document the code.
They are lines that are not executed by the Python interpreter, 
and they are purely for the benefit of developers and anyone else reading the code. 
Comments are ignored by the interpreter when the program is executed.

Proper indentation is crucial in Python because it is used to 
\define the structure and hierarchy of the code. 
Unlike many other programming languages, 
Python uses indentation to indicate blocks of code,
such as those within loops, conditionals, functions, and classes. 
Indentation in Python serves as a replacement for the more traditional
curly braces {} or keywords like begin and end found in languages like C, Java, or Pascal.

If indentation is incorrect in Python, it can lead to various issues, 
including syntax errors, logical errors, and unexpected behavior of the code. 
Python relies heavily on proper indentation to determine
the structure and organization of the code.

An expression in Python is a piece of code that produces a value.
It can be as simple as a single literal value or a complex combination of variables, 
operators, and function calls. Expressions can be used wherever a value is expected,
such as in assignments, 
function arguments, or within larger expressions.

#expression example

"""
A statement in Python is a complete instruction that performs an action. 
It represents a full command and can consist of one or more expressions.

#statement example

# Assignment statement
x = 10
